                                    BMJ’s vision is to help achieve a healthier world. We do this through publishing
                                    research, providing medical education and clinical decision support, and driving
                                    quality improvement in healthcare. COVID-19 has affected all of these activities.
                                    It has taught us the importance of publishing research quickly in a fast changing
                                    scientific environment. But we know we must also ensure that the research is of 
                                    high quality and reliable. Our medical education and decision support tools have
                                    always been continually updated, but the COVID pandemic has reinforced the importance
                                    of having updating processes that take into account new evidence on a daily basis. 
                                    Lastly the COVID pandemic has shown us once again that our users expect our content
                                    to be practical and to help answer their patients’ questions and solve their problems.
                                    This is challenging as the volume of scientific research is very great and there are
                                    ongoing questions about diagnosis, investigation, management, and prevention. However
                                    we remain committed to ensuring that our resources answer questions that will enable
                                    continuous clinical quality improvement.

                                <Box mt="10px">
                                    The COVID pandemic has shown the importance of collaboration to achieve the goals of 
                                    effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. This has required collaboration
                                    between primary care and secondary care; between doctors, nurses, and allied healthcare
                                    practitioners; and between the scientific community and clinicians on the frontline. Many
                                    patients with COVID-19 also have comorbidities and it is these patients who are often the
                                    most seriously ill. The management of patients with comorbidities requires a collaborative
                                    and team-based approach to achieve the holistic care that patients need. We have recently
                                    launched a new tool – BMJ Best Practice Comorbidities – to help interdisciplinary teams of
                                    healthcare professionals treat a patient’s infection with COVID-19 and associated comorbidities.
                                    This has proved vital during the pandemic - and will continue to be used into the future to help
                                    the growing number of patients with multiple communicable and non-communicable diseases.
